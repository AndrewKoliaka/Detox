                        <h2>Hartford Healthcare Rehabilitation Coverage | West Palm Beach</h2>
                        <p>Hartford Healthcare’s behavioral health network focuses on helping people struggling with addiction.
                            Their program is the Medication Assisted Treatment Close to Home or MATCH. MATCH assists the
                            rehabilitation for patients of all ages. Studies have made a link between behavioral issues and
                            addiction. Drugs and alcohol are often used as a gateway mechanism. Sometimes, people also use
                            them to function. When people become dependent on the substance, it becomes addiction. Addiction
                            is a slippery slope once it starts. If you’re not a member of Hartford Healthcare’s insurance,
                            it’s not too late. Even if you already have an existing addiction, Hartford encourages you to
                            seek them for help. Hartford’s representatives will find a suitable compromise.</p>
                        <h3>How do you start?</h3>
                        <p>First is to consult your physician. They will give you a full work-up, which Hartford will covered.
                            Your physician will then provide their diagnosis. After the diagnosis, you can contact Hartford’s
                            addiction specialists to start your program. For inpatient cases, consult with Hartford about
                            the centers closest to you. They need to confirm if the center is Hartford accredited.</p>

                        <h3>Inpatient vs Outpatient</h3>
                        <p>
                            Outpatient care is generally more affordable than inpatient treatments. They offer help for the patient while allowing the
                            patient to live their normal lives. Outpatient care is advisable for patients whose addiction
                            doesn’t cause potential harm. Another factor to consider is the other substances that the patients
                            take. It should not affect the treatment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inpatient care is more suited for cases where the patient requires constant monitoring. Patients need to stay in rehab centers
                            for a couple of weeks, sometimes months. Hartford’s plan can cover luxury rehab centers that
                            provide more amenities. These amenities include swimming pools, gym equipment and gourmet food.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Often, doctors recommend a supplementary outpatient program after a successful inpatient treatment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies had made healthcare affordable. Costs are now less of an excuse to
                            keep us from being healthy citizens. If your alcohol intake concerns you, speak to your health
                            insurance provider. Same goes if you know someone close to you who is also struggling. It’s never
                            too late to find help and it’s closer to you than ever.
